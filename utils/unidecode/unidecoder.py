'''
Decode unicode text to an ASCII representation of the text. Transliterate
unicode characters to ASCII.

Based on the ruby unidecode gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/unidecode/) which
is based on the perl module Text::Unidecode
(http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-0.04/). More information about
unidecode can be found at
http://interglacial.com/~sburke/tpj/as_html/tpj22.html.

The major differences between this implementation and others is it's written in
python and it uses a single dictionary instead of loading the code group files
as needed.
